SWE4643 Assignment 2
 In this assignment, we will practice developing a small web service application to send and retrieve data from a cloud-based database. 

Scenario: You want to develop a small grade calculator for KSU students. Students can enter an ID number and a grade in a webpage, and send it to the database. After submission, students will be taken to a page where they can see all ID numbers in the database, grades associated with the IDs, and the average grade of all students.

To complete this assignment, you should:

Set up a database on the cloud hosting platform
Develop at least two separate pages on your account
One to enter information
One to display the required information in the database
